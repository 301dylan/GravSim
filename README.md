# GravSim
Simulation of orbital motion

Collision definition
  points on radius of both circles touch
Stable orbits: 
  Assuming isolated system
  Could be object remains in orbit for >20 sec maybe
Escape
  Distance >2 AU
Color map
  Discrete so red = collision, green = orbit, yellow = escape
  RUn sim at each point (distance and intial velocity changes)
Values:
  Central Body Mass [CBM] = 1.989 x 10^30 kg
  Orbiting mass = 1.972 x 10^24 kg
  Distance = .1 to 5 AU 
  Velocity = 1 to 50 km 
  8 x 8 = 64 pointa total
